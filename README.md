Conceptualized as a way to bring "the world to your kitchen," this food site renders 10 searchable ethnic cuisines with 12 meal choices, respectively. The meal choices then generate ingredients, recipes and nutritional info using various APIs (Yummly and Edamam), and appear in modal form. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, ajax, Yummly and Edamam APIs, Adobe Photoshop.
